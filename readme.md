Hello there! In this project, I have developed a clone website for Razorpay, a popular online payments platform in India. The website is built using HTML and Tailwind CSS along with responsiveness. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style and layout web pages.

1) Home page with an overview of the services offered by Razorpay with Log In and  Sign Up.
2) Pricing page with a comparison table of different pricing plans 
3) A Sign-Up form Contact page with a form to submit your inquiries or feedbacks. 
4) Types of accounts section along with a demo section for the complete walkthrough of Razorpay's online website.
5) Features section describing about the features which Razorpay offers.
6) About page with information related to the company and its mission.
7) Testimonials & Call-to-Action section.
8) Footer section with links to social media profiles and legal pages. 

This website has a Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

# Getting Started

To run the website locally, TailWind CSS must be setted and then you can follow these steps :

1) Clone the repository to your local machine.

2) Open the index.html file into your Code Editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc. 

3) Open the terminal and run "npm run start".

4) In the terminal, you will see a local server, click on that.

5) Modify the HTML and Tailwind CSS files as needed to customize the website and setup Tailwind CSS on your project directory to get the benefits of it.

# Credits

The website design and content is based on the official Razorpay website (https://razorpay.com/), with some modifications to fit the scope of this project. The Tailwind CSS framework is used for styling and layout, with some custom CSS added for additional features.
