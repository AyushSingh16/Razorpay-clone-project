# Razorpay-Clone
Hello there!In this project, I have developed a clone website for Razorpay, a popular online payments platform in India. The website is built using HTML and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style and layout web pages.

# Features
The website includes the following pages and features: Home page with an overview of the services offered by Razorpay and a call-to-action button to sign up Pricing page with a comparison table of different pricing plans, a sign-up form Contact page with a form to submit inquiries or feedback About page with information about the company and its mission Footer section with links to social media profiles and legal pages Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

This project is static and currently in development, so in future you would get to see lots of updates in the near future. 

# Getting Started
To run the website locally, you can follow these steps :

Clone the repository to your local machine: Open the index.html file in your web browser. Modify the HTML and CSS files as needed to customize the website and setup Tailwind CSS on your project directory to get the benefits of it.

# Credits
The website design and content is based on the official Razorpay website (https://razorpay.com/), with some modifications to fit the scope of this project. The Tailwind CSS framework is used for styling and layout, with some custom CSS added for additional features.
